# blockchain
* ledger containing chain of blocks
* decentralised
* every block contains data about itself and hash ref to previous block
* public
* democratized
* fair
* no central point of failure
* almost impossible to hijack the blockchain network
* public database of transactions
* chain is protected by cryptography
* every block has unique digital signature

## wallet
* has a public and private key
* public key serves as an address of wallet
* private key helps making transactions

## mining
* when transaction is submitted, it is in a state of being unconfirmed
* miners take a group of those transactions and use their data to record it within a new block
* to gain a right to add a new block, miner must solve proof of work algorithm
* PoW is difficult to solve (to avoid being solved randomly)
* solving PoW gives a right to create a block out of unconfirmed transactions
* PoW is easy to verify
* after verification, block is included into the blockchain
* solving PoW gives a chance to receive a cryptocurrency
